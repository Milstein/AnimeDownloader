AnimeDownloader
===============

Go download yourself some anime!

Usage:

    python anime-downloader.py

The program will prompt you for input. Give it the name of the anime and then the episode number, and it will download the anime for you!

~~The name should be in this format: "sword-art-online"~~

Fuzzy string matching! Format doesn't matter!

This is a work in progress, it will become easier to use and more robust. But it works!

Example:
```
$ python anime-downloader.py
Enter an anime: Sword Art Online
Found sword-art-online!
Enter an episode: 1
Found episode 1!
Downloading!
Success!
